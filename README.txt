Extension for the Connections Business Directory that adds a shortcode and widget to display a login form.

== Description ==

This is an extension plugin for the [Connections Business Directory Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/connections/) please be sure to install and active it before adding this plugin.

What does this plugin do?
It adds an entry content block, a shortcode and a widget which displays a login form when a user is not logged into your site.

Ok, great, but how does this benefit me?
Well, if you have the directory setup to require login, you can add the `[connections_login]` shortcode to the login required message setting (or any page you want, the shortcode is not limited to this setting). When it is added and the user is not logged in and visit your directory, they'll be shown your message plus the login form.

The content block login form and the login widget are best used with [Link](http://connections-pro.com/add-on/link/) installed and activated. You can setup the login form content block to be shown on a single entry, that way when a user visits the page and they are not logged in, they'll be shown a login form right on their page. Alternatively, you could use the widget which will only be displayed on the single entry page when a user is not logged in. It's your choice, you could use either one or both.
